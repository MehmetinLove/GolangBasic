The crc32 hash object implements the Writer interface, so we can write bytes to it like any other Writer. Once we’ve written everything we want, we call Sum32() to
return a uint32. A common use for crc32 is to compare two files. If the Sum32 value
for both files is the same, it’s highly likely (though not 100% certain) that the files are
the same. If the values are different, then the files are definitely not the same:.
